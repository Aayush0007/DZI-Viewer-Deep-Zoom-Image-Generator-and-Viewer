## Deep Zoom Viewer - Client Side

###Project Overview

The client-side application enables users to interact with high-resolution images generated by Deep Zoom technology. Built using React and OpenSeadragon, it provides a seamless and responsive image viewing experience.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later) and npm

### Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

If you haven’t already cloned the repository, do so by running the following commands:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/deep-zoom-viewer.git
cd deep-zoom-viewer/client
```
### 2. Install Dependencies

Navigate to the client directory and install the required npm packages:
```bash
npm install
```
### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a .env file in the client directory and add the following variables to configure the client:
```bash
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:3001
```
- Replace http://localhost:3001 with your backend server URL if different.

### Running the Application

Start the React Development Server

Run the following command in the client directory to start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```
The application will be available at http://localhost:3000 by default.

### Features

- High-Resolution Image Viewer: Users can zoom in and out, pan, and explore high-resolution images using OpenSeadragon.

- Dynamic DZI File Loading: The application fetches .dzi files from the backend server and dynamically displays them in the viewer.

- Responsive Design: Ensures the viewer is accessible on both desktop and mobile devices.

### Folder Structure

Below is the folder structure of the client-side project:
```bash
client/
├── public/
│   ├── index.html       # HTML template
├── src/
│   ├── components/      # React components
│   ├── App.js           # Main application logic
│   ├── index.js         # Entry point of the React app
├── .env                 # Environment configuration
├── package.json         # Project dependencies and scripts
```
### Key Components

### 1. App.js

The main application component that handles folder navigation and integrates API calls to fetch the list of folders and their content.

### 2. Viewer.js

A component that integrates OpenSeadragon for rendering .dzi files. The viewer dynamically updates when a new URL is passed as a query parameter.

### 3. API Integration

The client interacts with the backend to fetch the list of available .dzi files via an API endpoint (/folder-content).

### Example Usage

1. Place images in the backend’s input directory.

2. Start the backend and Python daemon to generate .dzi files.

3. Start the client application.

4. View the images in the browser by navigating to http://localhost:3000.

### Deployment

To build the application for production, run the following command:
```bash
npm run build
```
This will create an optimized build in the build directory, which can be deployed to any static file hosting service.
